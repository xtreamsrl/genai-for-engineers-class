    "If you are developing customer-facing GenAI applications, you must take security seriously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your application will be vulnerable to various types of attacks, including prompt injections, malicious requests, and attempts to force data or prompt leakage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prompt Injection Attacks**: Attackers can craft inputs that manipulate the model's behavior in unintended ways. This can lead to the model generating harmful, misleading, or sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, developers can implement strict input validation, sanitize user inputs, and use context-aware filtering to detect and block suspicious patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Malicious Requests**: Adversaries may send requests designed to exploit vulnerabilities within the model or the surrounding infrastructure. To defend against such threats, it's essential to incorporate robust security measures such as rate limiting, authentication, and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Leakage**: Large language models can inadvertently reveal sensitive information contained within their training data or prompt history. Implementing techniques like differential privacy, which introduces noise to the data, and ensuring that training data is anonymized can help minimize this risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM security is an open problem with no definitive solution, but implementing guardrails can help. Establishing guardrails involves setting boundaries for the modelâ€™s behavior, defining acceptable use cases, implementing safety protocols, and continuously monitoring the modelâ€™s outputs for signs of misuse or deviation from expected norms. Automated systems can flag and review suspicious activity in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how our simple RAG pipeline can be subject to such attacks."
